# Research Summary: Final Year of PhD

This report provides an overview of the research projects I have undertaken during the last year of my PhD program.

## Key Areas of Focus:

- **Field-Informed Reinforcement Learning**: A hybrid methodology for developing distributed controllers aimed at enhancing collective intelligence.
  
- **Macro-Swarm**: A high-level API designed for articulating swarm behavior through the composable manipulation of low-level behaviors.

- **ScaRLIb**: A specialized library for multi-agent reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of cyber-physical systems.

- **FRASP**: A distributed computational model focused on self-organizing computations.
